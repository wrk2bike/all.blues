    "text": "Hurricane Beryl was a deadly and destructive Category 5 Atlantic hurricane that impacted parts of the Caribbean, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Gulf Coast of the United States in late June and early July 2024. It was the earliest-forming Category 5 hurricane on record during any season in the Atlantic and just the second in the month of July, the other being 2005's mid-July Hurricane Emily. Beryl was also the strongest hurricane to develop within the Main Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic before the month of July. The second named storm, first hurricane, and first major hurricane of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, Beryl was an atypical hurricane that, in addition to causing widespread destruction along its path across the Caribbean and United States, broke many meteorological records for the months of June and July, including its location, intensity and longevity. Beryl developed from a tropical wave that left the coast of Africa on June 25. After forming on June 28 in the Main Development Region, it began rapidly intensifying as it moved west through the central tropical Atlantic. On July 1, Beryl made landfall on the island of Carriacou in Grenada as a high-end Category 4 hurricane, causing extensive damage. The hurricane intensified further as it entered the Caribbean Sea, peaking as a Category 5 hurricane early the next morning with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 934 millibars (27.6 inHg), before slowly weakening over the next few days due to wind shear as it passed south of Jamaica and then the Cayman Islands. It briefly re-intensified to a Category 3 hurricane before weakening again as it made landfall in Tulum, Quintana Roo as a high-end Category 2 hurricane on July 5. Crossing the Yucatán Peninsula, where it quickly weakened to a tropical storm, the system moved into the Gulf of Mexico, where it gradually reorganized into a Category 1 hurricane on July 8, just before making a final landfall near Matagorda, Texas. Beryl quickly weakened as it accelerated to the northeast, eventually becoming post-tropical over the state of Arkansas the following day and impacting the Midwest. Effects and casualties from the hurricane were widespread. Beryl caused catastrophic damage on Grenada's northern islands of Carriacou and Petite Martinique and on several of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' southern islands such as Union Island and Canouan where many structures were damaged or destroyed. In Venezuela, three people were killed and several were missing. Sustained damage was also recorded in the Yucatan as well, although it was relatively minor. In the U.S, the state of Texas experienced severe flooding and wind damage, with reports of at least seven dead in the Houston region. Additionally, the outer bands of the hurricane produced a tornado outbreak, with tornadoes reported in Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Indiana, and New York. As of July 9, a total of 28 fatalities have been confirmed, and preliminary damage estimates are more than US$6 billion. "
